## SMS -> Weather

Inspired by a friend who likes adventure, this little node service takes a What3Words location via SMS and responds with a small weather forecast.

The idea is that you could use satellite messaging (like Apple's) to get forecasts in places where you don't have better connectivity to use typical weather services.
